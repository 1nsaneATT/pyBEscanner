Important info regarding changes

Version 13
	Revert Changes in 12,
	Recommend u use strict settings in createvehicle banlist etc instead...

Version 12
	Just a version incremant, so u will read this...
	The dayz-default\Createvehicle.banlist is now a catch all rule...
	It will ban for everything that isn't whitelisted...
	
	Its alot easier for us to just white-list the good items, and just have 1 rule to ban for everything else...
	If u are running a mod / map with items that need to be whitelist plz push an update / or make an issue on github. 
	Thx

Version 11
	Removed Spam Option from servers.ini
	Added Supported for selecting multiple filters

	Altered array format in (offset & spam) temp files slighty...
